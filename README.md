# Tensorflow 2.0 playground

This is my playground repo for experimenting with Tensorflow 2.0 which is still in preview. I want to explore the new APIs and figure out a programming model that works best with the up-coming release.

CPU only version installation:  
```bash
!pip install -q tensorflow==2.0.0-beta0
```
